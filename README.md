## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

My favorite apps:
1. Spotify:
   - Looping visual of each track
   - "Go to radio" feature that shows songs that are similiar to a given song
2. BeReal:
   - Take pictures with front camera and back camera simultaneously
   - React to other BeReals with instant emoji
   - Notify at a random time so users can upload their BeReals
3. Shazam:
   - Identify music based on a short sample played using the microphone on the device
   - Store recent Shazams
  
I want to turn my web app, musee, into an app on mobile devices. musee is a social media that allows users to send music recommendations to others. With musee, you can connect with your friends, send them your music (anonymously if you desire), and pin your current favorite song on your profile. It would be great if musee had a widget on IPhones.

## Notes

I encountered a mismatch error because there was an inconsistency between my code and the connections set up in the Storyboard but then I was able to fix it by deleting the old connections and recreate them.
